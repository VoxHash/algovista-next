# AlgoVista - Environment Variables
# 
# This project currently doesn't require any environment variables.
# All configuration is handled through code.
#
# If you need to add environment variables in the future, add them here.
# For Next.js, use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side variables.
#
# Example:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
# API_KEY=your-api-key-here
